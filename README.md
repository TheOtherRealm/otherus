A dating app that is open source, non for profit, privacy focused, and cooperatively run by and for single individuals 

# Key principles behind the project:
- Must be open source, non for profit, and made by and for single individuals 
- Must be both privacy focused and cooperatively run, so that the application helps people and not the other way around
- *Given many people will probably not be aware of the application or feel like they want to use it, have a system of introducing non-connected individuals with user in real life without needing to sign up or have anything to do with the app
- Have a system where, if someone is not a good fit for you but, would be great for someone you know, connects the two as a sort of "match maker" setup.
- A possible way of generating revenue would be to have a match making service that contracts with independent "Match Makers" and has a set fee like every other trading platform.  To get around the income disparities, have a system where, for every person who pays for a match maker, the longest active user without a match would also get to meet with a match maker.

*not quite sure how this could be implemented without needing to gather a ton of data on everyone
